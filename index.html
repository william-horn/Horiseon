    ================
    == CHANGE LOG ==
    ================

    ? @info:
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Change log is recorded with change id, denoted by: #change:xxxx-"description about change". The change id index is recorded
    under "@change-log" and is where all information about the change(s) are stored. Within the document code, a change id is given 
    near the sections of code that have been modified. The modified code is wrapped between two comment lines that read:

        THIS    #change:xxxx-"description about change" // BEGIN // 
        AND         ...[[code affected by change]]...
        THIS    #change:xxxx-"description about change" \\ END \\

    note: The current format for this change log is experimental so any feedback on it's efficacy is appreciated :)

    ? @change-log:
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    * #change:0001-"<title> tag content replaced"
        -   Replaced previous <title> tag content from "website" to more descriptive "Horiseon"

    * #change:0002-"replaced <div> with <header>"
        -   Replaced <div class="header"> tag with semantic <header> tag

    * #change:0003-"replaced <div> with <section>"
        -   Replaced generic <div class="hero"> tag with semantic <section class="hero"> tag for hero banner section

    * #change:0004-"removed seo class"
        !-   Removed "seo" class from <span> tag as it was deemed unnecessary
            The CSS will now target the span tag instead.

    * #change:0005-"replaced <div> with <section>"
        -   Replaced generic <div class="content"> tag with semantic <section class="content"> tag for page content section

    * #change:0006-"replaced <section> classes with id"
        !-   Removed the following classes in the outer-most <section> tags: 
                ! class="search-engine-optimization"
                ! class="online-reputation-management"
                ! class="social-media-marketing"

            These classes have been replaced with their respective IDs. This was done so that the links in the header will correctly
            navigate to the correct content on the page, and because the classes were replaced with type selectors in the CSS due to
            repetitive code (multiple different class declarations with the same properties).

    * #change:0007-"replaced <div> with <section>"
        -   Replaced generic <div class="benefits"> tag with semantic <section class="benefits"> tag for benefits section

    * #change:0008-"replaced <div> with <footer>"
        -   Replaced generic <div class="footer"> tag with semantic <footer> tag for page footer

    * #change:0009-"replaced <div> with <nav>"
        -   Replaced generic <div> tag with <nav> tag to contain the internal webpage navigation links

    * #change:000a-"replaced <div> with <section>"
        -   Replaced generic <div> tags with <section> tags. Each content block within the parent container meets the 
            criteria for a <section> element.

    * #change:000b-"added img alts"
        -   Added descriptive `alt` attributes to all images within change block.

    * #change:000c-"removed all classes in section"
        -   All classes within this section were removed due to repetitive code in the CSS (multiple different class declarations
            storing the same properties). These classes have been replaced with type selectors.
